# Buddy

## Overview

**Buddy** is a hybrid system designed to alleviate loneliness experienced by immigrant parents by facilitating community engagement through both mobile and physical interactions. The system combines a mobile application with physical screens placed in schools to support meaningful connections and interactions between parents.

## Key Features

- **Mobile App**: Allows users to manage their profiles, join events, and interact with other parents.
- **Physical Screen**: Situated in schools, enabling users to browse events, connect with other parents, and visualise community activities.
- **Buddy-Up System**: Suggests connections between users based on shared interests, location, and other commonalities.
- **Event Calendar**: Provides a centralised view of upcoming events in the community, allowing users to RSVP and join group chats.
- **Multilingual Support**: The app and physical screens support multiple languages to accommodate diverse immigrant backgrounds.

## Project Structure

- **buddy-mobile**: Contains the mobile app, developed using React Native. The mobile app supports user interactions, event management, and communication between parents.
- **buddy-physical**: Includes the code for the physical screen, which displays events, map of cultural diversity, visualisations of forum information, and supports interactions via touch screens.
